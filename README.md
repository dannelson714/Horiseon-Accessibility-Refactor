# Horiseon-Accessibility-Refactor

## Description

In this project I acted as a developer for the marketing agency Horiseon. My goal was to take existing code for their home page and refactor the html and CSS to better adhere to accessibility standards and better optimize their site for
search engines.

The primary problems that I solved were converting older html elements to more accessible semantic elements. In addition, I reorganized the semantic elements, and, in particular, reorganized the CSS to agree in structure and logic with the semantic html elements.
